See [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) for details on Z3.

## Documentation

The API is fully documented with examples:
[https://docs.rs/z3-sys/](https://docs.rs/z3-sys/)

## Installation

This crate works with Cargo and is on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/z3-sys).
Add it to your `Cargo.toml` like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
z3-sys = "0.7.1"
```

**Note:** This crate requires a `z3.h` during build time.

* By default, the crate will look for a `z3.h` in standard/system include paths.
* If the feature `static-link-z3` is enabled, the `z3.h` of the built Z3 will be used.
* Alternatively, the path to the desired `z3.h` can be specified via the environment variable
`Z3_SYS_Z3_HEADER`. I.e., running:

```console
$ Z3_SYS_Z3_HEADER="/path/to/my/z3.h" cargo build
```

in your project will use `/path/to/my/z3.h` instead.

## Support and Maintenance
